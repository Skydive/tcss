	- Left: Group selection (Add+Delete)
	- Right: 
		- Top: Group editing/information 
		- Bottom: Members (Add+Delete)
			- On Add (CYCLE the interface)
			- On Delete (Select + Confirm)
				- (Modal to review jQ-UI)
	- Tweaks:
		- (ContentTools Merge [LATER]) for group editing (Desktop)

26-12-18/27-12-18:
- Finish the TCSS booklet with speaker names from either Ruslan/Luke

28-12-18:
- Write ALL OF ContentTools (News)
	- Reverse engineer to add sub-instances... (CoffeeScript... :/)
	- (+) -> Add article
	- (E) -> Edit existing article
	- Time/Date FILTER

29-12-18:
- Add pagination and a dashboard navbar for further options
	- Note: possible structural changes to build system/tool
- Make everything mobile friendly
	- Note: Time consuming (good practice)

- Bugfixes:
	- Fix build tool .html <script> inline js not minifying upon deploy
	- Speed up deploy (callbacks aren't managed properly in the pipeline)
	- Use PUMP at some point

- Tweaks:
	- FIX GLOBALS structure -> use an abstract class
	- Fetch ALL information of user upon validating token
		- Make this scale reasonably well
	- Add loaders to ajax requests

- Future Features:
	- Code the ContentTools (news) editing (HARD - rewrite their coffeescript???)
		- Should I support image uploading?!?!?
	- Code a society management pinboard?!?!? (Fucking TRELLO)
	- Code the theming of the dashboard to scale
	- Think of additional features to add
	- Think of a way to PIVOT all of this even further
		- TCSS --> All Societies --> ??? ??? ???
	- Add info bubbles everywhere

- Scalability concerns:
	- Atlas doesn't scale past 3 years...
	- This is an intrinsic problem with the cambridge system
